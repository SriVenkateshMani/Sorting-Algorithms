## 🫧 Bubble Sort

### Overview

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, meaning the list is sorted.

### Time & Space Complexity

- **Best Case:** O(n) _(already sorted)_
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – in place sorting

### 🔁 Algorithm Logic

- Traverse the array multiple times
- On each pass, compare each pair of adjacent items
- Swap them if they are in the wrong order
- Repeat until a full pass requires no swaps
